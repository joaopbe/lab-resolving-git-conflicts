# Who am I

My name is João Eira and I am from Lisbon, Portugal. I have been a Telecom Engineer for the past 10+ years.
I have experience in technology, particularly related to Mobile (2G/3G/4G/5G) Networks, but little experience in coding.

# Why am I here

In mid 2019 I decided to switch my career to the AI/ Data Science/ Machine Learning spectrum. As I did training on my own, I stumbled upon Ironhack and it seemed the ideal opportunity to start getting practical/"real world" skills on this space.

I expect to get from this bootcamp Efficient coding, Data Analysis and Mining, Applied Machine Learning

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

My goal is to become an expert data analyst/machine learning engineer. Primarily the telecom sector might be the most natural area, but I am open to experiences in other areas.

Ideally, in my future role I will be helping companies transition to AI/ML usage and helping them use data to improve their products/efficiency

In 5 yrs, my goal is to be a digital nomad/remote consultant.
